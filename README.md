# Intel-Facebook-Study---Data-Structure-
Data Structure and Algorithms are the foundational knowledge for students who want to become the professional developers. Here, I have tried to collect the coding technique from the giant's open projects such as Intel in order to study the unique technique. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have tried to compare between Intel and Facebook for the techniqual frameworks of data structure in order to explore the the best solutions for the problems of basic knowledge. In the Folly_map_guideline file, there are some files which the front of their name has a "red star". This means that the Facebook techinical frameworks have been compared with Intel or Microsoft by adding the reference links at the top of the files.

Note: Because I have tried to code myself based on original files in order to STUDY profoundly Intel coding technique, so there is any problem related to coding technique, please check the Intel original files.
